  newfoundland_referendum: "Fate of Newfoundland"
  newfoundland_referendum_reason: "With the end of World War 2 and the criplingly level of debt that the United Kingdom has accrued, the United Kingdom is looking for ways to cut expenses. Since 1934 when Newfoundland gave up self-government due to their inability to service their public debt, the United Kingdom has been operating Newfoundland as a Dependent Territory at a significant cost to their budget. With World War 2 finished, now is the time to determine the fate of Newfoundland in this post-WW2 world."
  newfoundland_referendum_goal: "Proceed through the decisions, debates, and voting until the fate of Newfoundland has been decided."
